					Spin soft serves corporations, governments, and non-profit institutions to help them grow.

We work across virtually all industries and in all parts of the world.

Our clients share an aspiration to lead in their fields and a desire to harness new ideas, unconstrained by conventional wisdom, for the benefit of their organizations. We have doubled growth rates for our relationship clients, and 85% of our revenues have historically been derived from repeat clients.
</p>

<br>
				<p>
Our clients are predominantly companies in industries that are in transition and where they need to make a significant move but are unclear precisely what to do. We typically work for CEOs, business unit heads and other members of the senior management team. Almost all of our clients are multi-national in scope or aspiration. Most of our revenue is derived from Fortune 500 clients (and their international equivalents) but we also serve selected mid-tier companies very effectively.
