		<h3>Our People</h3>
		<p>
			All SpinSoft people are problem solvers, who care deeply about their clients, and who want things to happen. They are people capable of helping clients productively work through the tough issues and choices that are at the heart of every growth opportunity.

Our people join SpinSoft because they want to help organizations grow, because they want to have an impact on the world, and because they value the unique skills and insights they will develop from the diverse career paths available in our firm.
		</p>
		<br>
		We select people who share our aspiration to create a new kind of services firm, one where leading-edge intellectual content combines with a diverse array of human, technical, and financial assets to help our client organizations grow and win. We are a firm that offers rich learning experiences and that rewards and promotes people based on the value they create, not on arbitrary measures such as seniority.
	</p>
	<br>
	Our people, in other words, are entrepreneurial leaders. They have outstanding educational backgrounds from the world's top universities. Monitor alumni go on to serve in some of the most critical positions in industry, government and social sector organizations worldwide, and some found their own organizations.

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>
We work with organizations to help them grow.
For corporations, that often means developing strategies for revenue growth. For governments, it means working on national economic development. For non-profits, it means helping to grow their social impact.
</p>
<br><p>
We address all the problems that are involved in growth: strategy, marketing, pricing, innovation, product development, organization, leadership, economic competitiveness. In many cases, the work we do to unlock growth involves integrating all these areas in a customized way.
</p>
<br><p>
We do advisory projects for senior management teams on issues of significant strategic importance to the client organization. These can be as short as a few months or involve transformative actions over many years.
</p>
<br><p>
We also design and implement capability-building-programs to instill new skills and approaches in clients so they can grow faster on their own.
</p>
<br><p>
We provide financial advisory services. Through our preferred access to the managing partners of our investment affiliates, we gain real world insight into capital transaction design.
Monitor provides its clients with an integrated resource for growth.

<h3>Why Spinsoft</h3>




<p> 

What Makes Us Different?

Here's how one client put it: "All our other advisors stand on their side of the river and shout advice about how to cross it; Monitor people stand on our side of the river and help us get across."

The experience of working with Monitor, our clients tell us, is distinctively different. Here are some of the ways we are different.
Working Well at Multiple Levels
</p>

<p> 
We know that senior management wishing something to happen doesn’t make it so—it is critical for several layers in the organization to be motivated and enabled to move, convinced the direction is correct and invested in the overall plan. We do that well, working with people at all levels in an organization. As one client said: "Every consultant focuses on the corner office—that’s obvious. But you also work with our whole organization, so when we are ready to move we can move faster."
Starting from You

</p>

<p>
We start from your situation and customize everything we do. We help you find the best way for your organization to solve the challenge at hand. The ideas, approaches, and methods we bring to bear on client problems are the most sophisticated and powerful in the world, but we apply them in a highly pragmatic and customized way. We also train our people to tackle hard issues with great empathy. As one client said: "Our guys can tend to avoid tough political issues. But somehow Monitor people get the hard questions on the table in a way that enables us to talk about them productively. That is really something."
Multi-talented Teams for Complex Problems

</p>

<p>  
Sustainable growth requires addressing multiple barriers to growth which in turn require multiple management disciplines. We deploy teams with extraordinary breadth and depth of expertise to match the complexity of the challenges they are intended to solve. While we have industry expertise—lots of it—we don’t rely on that alone. We have deep expertise in the different management disciplines required to unlock superior growth. While we provide advisory services—on the most critical issues impacting many of the world’s most significant organizations—we are not just a consulting firm. We help our clients build their own capabilities for lasting results, and we offer capital services that complement our strategic advisory work.
Content/Intellectual Property
</p>

<p>

Monitor has an unprecedented commitment to creating content that can help organizations grow. We take everything we learn and turn it into systematic approaches that can be transferred to clients. Our knowledge is distilled into tools and frameworks that are practical, replicable and learnable by our client organizations. We deliver our IP through not just the traditional people-based consulting channel but also through software and executive education programs.
